This is a simple little program that translates Itanium assembler to CLIPS
expert systems function calls. I used it for my final project in my expert
systems class to make testing of my expert system basic block scheduler far
easier.

This is licensed under the BSD license.

You're going to need Extensions, Collections, Starlight, Tycho,
LexicalAnalysis, and Parser/Parsing.

When cloning these you have to make sure they are in the Libraries folder. This
is where the makefile looks to compile everything

Another thing to note is that when pulling down Parser you need to make sure
the folder is named Parsing. I will get around to fixing this but for the time
being just clone the Parser repo and tell git to save the contents in
Libraries/Parsing.

Enjoy!
